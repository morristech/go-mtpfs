INTRODUCTION

Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE filesystem for mounting Android devices as a
MTP device.

It will expose all storage areas of a device in the mount, and only
reads file metadata as needed, making it mount quickly. It uses
Android extensions to read/write partial data, so manipulating large
files requires no extra space in /tmp.

It has been tested on various flagship devices (Galaxy Nexus, Xoom,
Nexus 7).  As of Jan. 2013, it uses a pure Go implementation of MTP,
which is based on libusb.



COMPILATION

* Install the Go compiler suite; e.g. on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install golang-go

* Install libmtp header files

    sudo apt-get install libusb1-devel

* Then run

    mkdir /tmp/go 
    export GOPATH=/tmp/go
    go get github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs

  /tmp/go/bin/go-mtpfs will then contain the program binary.

* A 32 and 64-bit linux x86 binaries are at

USAGE

  mkdir xoom
  go-mtpfs xoom &
  cp -a ~/Music/Some-Album xoom/Music/
  fusermount -u xoom

After a file is closed (eg. if "cp" completes), it is safe to unplug
the device; the filesystem then will continue to function, but
generates I/O errors when it reads from or writes to the device.
